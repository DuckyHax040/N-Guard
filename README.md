# 🛡️ N-Guard v1.0 Advanced EDR-Ready Malware Defense Toolkit

**CyberGuard Pro** is an enterprise-grade **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** toolkit designed to protect Windows systems from modern cyber threats. It combines **static analysis**, **behavioral monitoring**, **machine learning**, **cloud intelligence**, and **real‑time response** to detect, analyze, and neutralize malware, ransomware, and network attacks.

> **⚠️ Important**  
> This tool is intended for **security professionals**, **system administrators**, and **researchers**. It requires **administrator privileges** for full functionality (ETW, registry monitoring, firewall blocking).

## ✨ Key Features

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **🔍 Static Analysis** | – Hash calculation (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)<br>– File type detection via magic bytes<br>– Deep PE analysis (suspicious imports, entropy, packers, entry point anomalies, timestamp checks)<br>– String extraction (with size limits) & heuristic pattern matching (URLs, PowerShell, base64, ransomware keywords)<br>– **YARA rule scanning** (hot‑reload support) |
| **🧠 Machine Learning** | – Random Forest classifier trained on file features (size, entropy, suspicious imports, packed status, digital signature)<br>– Real‑time probability scoring integrated into threat scoring engine |
| **☁️ Cloud Intelligence** | – **VirusTotal** hash lookup (with optional file upload, size‑limited to 32 MB)<br>– **AbuseIPDB** IP reputation check for outbound connections |
| **📊 Behavioral Monitoring** | – **File system** (watchdog) – monitors file creation/modification in watched directories<br>– **Process** (psutil) – detects new processes, network connections, file access, suspicious command lines<br>– **Network** – detects port scans (SYN‑sent tracking) and automatically blocks offending IPs via Windows Firewall<br>– **ETW (Windows)** – monitors security events (process creation) – needs admin<br>– **Registry** – monitors persistence locations (Run, RunOnce, Services) |
| **⚖️ Threat Scoring** | Weighted scoring from all detectors, producing a verdict:<br>– **CLEAN** (0‑4)<br>– **SUSPICIOUS** (5‑9)<br>– **MALICIOUS** (10‑14)<br>– **CRITICAL** (15+) |
| **🚨 Response Actions** | – Automatic **quarantine** (AES‑256 encrypted ZIP with password)<br>– **Sandbox execution** via Sandboxie‑Plus (if installed)<br>– **Process termination** (whitelist‑protected)<br>– Interactive prompts for user decisions<br>– All events logged to **SQLite** database and shown in **real‑time web dashboard** |
| **🌐 Web Dashboard** | Built with **Flask** – live alerts, system stats, easy monitoring at `http://localhost:5000` |

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Windows** (for full EDR capabilities; some features work on Linux, but ETW, registry, and firewall blocking are Windows‑only)
- **Administrator privileges** (for ETW, firewall blocking, and some registry monitoring)

### Python Libraries

Install all dependencies with `pip` (see [Installation](#installation)):

```
yara-python, requests, pefile, psutil, watchdog, python-magic, python-dotenv,
pyzipper, joblib, scikit-learn, numpy, flask, pywin32
```

---

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whoamiii302-arch/N-Guard.git
cd N-Guard
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install manually:

```bash
pip install yara-python requests pefile psutil watchdog python-magic python-dotenv pyzipper joblib scikit-learn numpy flask pywin32
```

> **Note for `python-magic` on Windows**:  
> Install `python-magic-bin` instead:  
> `pip install python-magic-bin`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### API Keys (optional but recommended)

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```ini
VT_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key_here
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=your_abuseipdb_api_key_here
```

- **VirusTotal API key**: Get one from [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com) (free tier available).
- **AbuseIPDB API key**: Register at [abuseipdb.com](https://www.abuseipdb.com).

If no keys are provided, cloud features will be disabled.

### YARA Rules

Place your YARA rule files (`.yar` or `.yara`) inside the `rules/` directory. The tool automatically loads all rules and **hot‑reloads** them when changes are detected.

Example rules are provided in the repository.

### Monitored Directories

By default, the tool monitors its own base directory. You can change this by editing `Config.MONITORED_DIRS` in the code or by adding your own configuration mechanism (not yet exposed via CLI).

---

## 🚀 Usage

CyberGuard Pro provides three operation modes:

### 1️⃣ Interactive CLI

Run the tool without arguments to enter an interactive menu:

```bash
python n-guard.py
```

You will see:
```
Options:
1. Scan file
2. Scan directory
3. Start monitoring
4. Show recent alerts
5. Exit
```

### 2️⃣ Command‑line scanning

```bash
# Scan a single file
python n-guard.py scan path/to/file.exe

# Scan all files in a directory recursively
python n-guard.py scan path/to/directory
```

### 3️⃣ Real‑time monitoring

```bash
python n-guard.py monitor
```

This starts all enabled monitors (file, process, network, ETW, registry). The web dashboard becomes available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

---

## 🌐 Web Dashboard

When monitoring mode is active, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`. The dashboard shows:

- **Recent alerts** with timestamp, source, target, score, and verdict.
- **System statistics** (number of processes, CPU, memory usage).

The dashboard auto‑refreshes every 2 seconds.

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

1. **First scan** of `suspicious.exe`:
   - Hashes calculated.
   - YARA matches detected → score +3.
   - PE analysis shows packed section → score +2.
   - VT lookup returns "Not found", user prompted to upload.
   - Total score = 5 → **SUSPICIOUS**.
   - User chooses to quarantine.

2. **Second scan** of the same file (after quarantine):
   - Cache hit: file already in database with score 5 → result returned instantly.

3. **Monitoring mode**:
   - A new file `malware.exe` is created in the watched directory.
   - FileMonitorHandler triggers a scan.
   - ProcessMonitor detects a new process connecting to a suspicious IP.
   - IP checked against AbuseIPDB → score 80 → alert generated.
   - Firewall rule added to block that IP.

---

## 🛠 Advanced Topics

### Customizing Scoring Weights

Edit the `SCORE_*` constants in the `Config` class inside `n-guard.py`.

### Adding New Detectors

The tool is designed with extensibility in mind. You can add new monitoring or analysis classes and integrate them into `CyberGuardCore`.

### Running as a Windows Service

To run CyberGuard Pro as a background service, you can use **NSSM** (Non‑Sucking Service Manager) or wrap it with `pythonw.exe` and a batch script.
